# RDR2ModMover
Change between modded RDR2 and RDO with the press of a button!
Simply put the [ModMover](https://github.com/SacorZ/RDR2ModMover/blob/master/RDR2ModMover.exe) in your gamefolder where the rdr2.exe is located!


When trying to run and it and theres no .NET 8 installed, a prompt will ask you to download it from Microsoft. 
Simply install it and rerun!
