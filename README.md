# RDR2ModMover
To use the [ModMover](https://github.com/SacorZ/RDR2ModMover/blob/master/RDR2ModMover.exe) simply put it in your gamefolder where the rdr2.exe is located!


When trying to run and it and you dont have .NET 8 installed, a prompt will ask you to download it from Microsoft. 
Simply install it and rerun!



Thank you for using my ModMover!
